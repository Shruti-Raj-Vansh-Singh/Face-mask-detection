# Face-mask-detection
In this project we will try to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. We will draw a bounding box around the faces of people that are seen in the
image and mark it as masked or unmasked.

For this we will be using YOLOv5, ie, You Only Look Once algo. It is an object detection algorithm that provides us a bounding box and a label on the object in the image. 


What we ned to do is to train our model on tour own dataset. One of the biggest task here is to prepare our data for YOLOv5. For this we can
